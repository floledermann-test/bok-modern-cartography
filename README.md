# A Body of Knowledge for Modern Cartography


## Preface / Guidelines

- Not a curriculum (but potential basis for curriculum development)
- No 1:1 mapping of ICA commissions, GIS&T BoK etc. (although informed by these)
- Entries are not of equal importance & volume, but should identify distinct topics
- Should identify core and related fields, linking to other disciplines / BOKs
- Each field should focus on aspects of the *digital*
- For the start, tend to include more and in a flat hierarchy - later on, identify nesting and related topics from other disciplines which are prerequisites for but not core of cartography

"A body of knowledge is the accepted ontology for a specific domain." [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_knowledge)] - so more work on refining the formal aspects may be needed!

Currently, this is only a table of contents - eventually, each topic should be linked to its own page with an overview description of the topic and its key concepts, definitions, resources, bibliography, learning objectives, and links to other fields and related / prerequisite topics. If you want to start with a topic you are familiar with, [go ahead](#how-to-contribute)!
